This app is perfect for grade school students learning their addition and multiplication facts.  

The app takes a user supplied integer from 1 to 12 and calculates the sum and product of that number using integer from 1 to 12.  The app shows the results in a table and in a plot.  

Use the slider to select the number.  
Select the desired operation from the choices (addition, multiplication, or both).
Use the tabs to navigate between the table and the plots.
