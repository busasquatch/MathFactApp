### Addition and Multiplication Tables and Plots  

### Instructions  
Use the slider on the left of the page to select an integer. That number will be added and/or multiplied with every integer from 1 to 12. A table and plot of the resulting sums and/or products will be displayed in a table and a plot.  

On the left, below the slider, opt to produce the addition results, multiplcation results, or both.  

Click on the **Table** and **Plot** tabs to view the results. While the tables might be familiar to grade school students, the plot is particularly interesting to visualize the difference between addition and multiplication.
